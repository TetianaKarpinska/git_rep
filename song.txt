The city streets are wet with rain tonight
Taxi drivers swerve from lane to lane
A lonely guitar man playin' down the hall
Midnight blues comin' through the walls

I tried to call you on the telephone
I left it off the hook
Just to hear it ring
You told me you were better off alone
I never knew that tears could stain

I'm on the roof and I'm starin' at the stars
Lookin' down at all the cars
I can see you
In the window of your favorite corner bar
But to reach you is just too far
And I might as well be on mars

The city seems so old and grey and beat
It closes in and makes me want to suffocate
And you just live across the street
But that's a billion miles away

You've turned my world into a dark and lonely place
Like a planet lost in space, my light is fadin'
I'd cross the universe to be right where you are
